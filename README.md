# Typing Text Animation (React)

Simple, lightweight, no external libraries or hooks.  
Just copy the component(jsx and css) and import them in your React Component :blush:

You need to provide 2 props to the component:  
- `heading (optional)`: String element, display the text as heading, stays at front and won't have a typing effect
- `dataText`: Array element, could have multiple strings to display texts in an order with typing effect.
